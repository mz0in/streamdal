Snitch uses a variety of terms which can have various meanings across 
industries and use-cases. This section exists to help clear up any ambiguity 
around Snitch [core-components](/en/core-components/overview/) or functionality.

### audience

A term we have come up with that identifies a specific service + operation 
type (consumer or producer), name for the operation type and a component. The 
audience can be referenced using the following slug:
  - `$service_name:$operation_type:$operation_name:$component_name`

The only exposure to the `audience` concept that an SDK has is via the 
`NewAudience()` internal gRPC method which is used by the SDK to announce the 
existence of a new audience. The audience contains the elements needed to be 
able to draw the most basic service map entry, eg: `service` ↔ `producer` ↔ 
`component`.

### condition

A condition is associated with a step. It defines how the SDK should react to 
the result of a step execution. The condition might be configured to **ABORT** 
the pipeline if a step results in a failure or an error.

### pipeline

A pipeline is a set of steps and conditions. A user would configure one or more 
steps for a specific producer or consumer - the result would be a pipeline 
(that is sent to the SDK client via gRPC).

### shims

A wrapper library for popular libraries that incorporate the usage of our SDK 
to simplify integration and adoption of `snitch`.
- **Example**: we would develop a shim for Python’s HTTP request library called 
`requests`. This shim would be a lightweight fork of `requests` that would call 
on `snitch_sdk.Process(..)` whenever the user would POST, PUT, DELETE or GET 
data. The shim simplifies and speeds up initial onboarding and  integration.

### step / rule

A step (or a rule) is a single unit of “work” that the SDK will run against a 
payload.
- **Example**: User might create a step that ensures that the payload always 
contains a field called `id` which MUST be of the `uuid` format.

### wasm

WASM is WebAssembly. We use this technology in steps. A step consists of a 
configuration (ie. what is the name of this step, what WASM function should it 
run with what parameters, etc.) AND the actual WASM bytes that will be executed 
by the SDK.
