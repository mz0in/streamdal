Streamdal uses a variety of terms which can have various meanings across 
industries and use-cases. This section exists to help clear up any ambiguity 
around Streamdal [core-components](/en/core-components/overview/) or 
functionality.

### <span class="pkeyword">Audience</span>

A term we have come up with that identifies a specific service + operation 
type (`consumer` or `producer`), name for the operation type and a component. 
The audience can be referenced using the following slug:
  - `$service_name:$operation_type:$operation_name:$component_name`

The only exposure to the `audience` concept that an 
[SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) has is via the `NewAudience()` internal 
[gRPC](/en/engineering/grpc/) method which is used by the 
[SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) to announce the existence of a new audience. 
The `audience` contains the elements needed to be able to draw the most basic 
[Data Graph](/en/core-components/console-ui/#data-graph) entry, eg: `service` ↔ `producer` ↔ 
`component`.

### <span class="pkeyword">Condition</span>

A `condition` is associated with a step. It defines how the 
[SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) should react to the result of a step 
execution. The condition might be configured to **ABORT** the `pipeline` if a 
`step` results in a failure or an error.

### <span class="pkeyword">Consumer</span>

A `consumer` generally refers to any function, method, or component that takes 
input (or data) and does something with it. A `consumer` consumes data, but may 
not necessarily produce output. 

For example, a function that logs data to the console, writes data to a file, 
or updates a UI element can be considered a `consumer` because it acts on the 
data but doesn't give you something to work with afterward.

Sometimes a `consumer` will take in data, process it, and produce new or 
transformed data - this is hybrid of "consumer/producer" functionality is 
sometimes referred to as a "transformer."

### <span class="pkeyword">Pipeline</span> or <span class="pkeyword">Ruleset</span>

A `pipeline` is a set of `steps` and conditions. A user would configure one or 
more steps for a specific producer or consumer - the result would be a pipeline 
(that is sent to the [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) client via [gRPC](/en/engineering/grpc/)).

### <span class="pkeyword">Producer</span>

A `producer` typically refers to a function, method, or component that generates 
or produces data. It can be thought of as a source of data in a data flow 
pipeline.

Sometimes a `producer` will take in data, process it, and produce new or 
transformed data - this is hybrid of "producer/consumer" functionality is 
sometimes referred to as a "transformer."

### <span class="pkeyword">Shims</span>

A [wrapper library](/en/core-components/libraries-shims/) for popular libraries 
that incorporate the usage of our [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) to simplify 
integration and adoption of Streamdal.

  - **Example**: we would develop a shim for Python’s HTTP request library called 
  `requests`. This shim would be a lightweight fork of `requests` that would call 
  on `streamdal_sdk.Process(..)` whenever the user would POST, PUT, DELETE or GET 
  data. The shim simplifies and speeds up initial onboarding and  integration.

### <span class="pkeyword">Rule</span> or <span class="pkeyword">Step</span>

A `step` (or a `rule`) is a single unit of “work” that the 
[SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) will run against a payload.
- **Example**: User might create a step that ensures that the payload always 
contains a field called `id` which MUST be of the `uuid` format.

### <span class="pkeyword">WASM</span>

`WASM` is <a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank">WebAssembly</a>. 
We use this technology in `steps`. A step consists of a configuration 
(ie. what is the name of this step, what WASM function should it run with what 
parameters, etc.) - AND the actual WASM bytes that will be executed by the 
[SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/).
