Streamdal. Can't find what you're looking for or need more details? Get in

<Accordion 
title="What is Streamdal?">
<p>
Streamdal is a data observability and governance tool designed to give the most 
upstream, actionable view of all of your producers and consumers. By using our 
SDK and deploying it's server, you'll get a dynamic graph of your producers and 
consumers as they scale up and down, with the ability to tap in and view all 
the real-time data flowing through them.
</p>
<br />
<p>
The views into your data are like having a UI on top of a `tail -f`, but for 
_real-time data_, not data at rest. With Streamdal, you'll but able to detect 
and resolve data incidents faster, as well as proactively act on and govern 
data in real time.
</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion 
title="How do I use Streamdal, and where is it deployed?">
<p>
1. Import our SDK for your language.
2. Weave the `Process()` method into the fabric of your code where 
data production or consumption takes place.
3. Deploy the Streamdal server where the services using the Streamdal SDK are 
running.
</p>
<br />
<p> 
You can find more details in our guides on 
[instrumentation](/en/guides/instrumentation/) and 
[deployment](/en/guides/deployment/).
</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion 
title="What language SDKs do you support?">
<p>
Currently we support [Go](/en/language-support/go/), 
[Node](/en/language-support/node/), and [Python](/en/language-support/python/). 
More language support will be coming in the future. Check out the 
[roadmap](/en/resources-support/roadmap/) for more details.
</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion 
title="What data sources and destinations are supported?">
<p>
Any source, and any destination. The way Streamdal is instrumented, there isn't 
a need for connectors or interfacing with various API's. The SDK uses a 
`Process()` method that is wrapped around the parts of your code where data 
production and consumption take place.
</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion 
title="Will this cause HTTP bottlenecks, or impact my app performance in any 
way?">
<p>
Using Streamdal adds < 1% of overhead to existing calls. The Streamdal server 
is _normally_ deployed locally where your services run, so there is no 
additional network hop for existing messages, events, calls, etc. Current 
benchmarks handle ~144,000 req/s.
</p>
<br />
<p>
Check out our 
[benchmark tests](https://github.com/streamdal/snitch-detective/blob/main/src/test_bench.rs) 
on github.
</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion 
title="Why aren't my services, producers, or consumers showing up on the data 
graph?">
<p>
In order for the data graph to visually populate services:
</p>
<br />
<p>
1. The Streamdal SDK should be imported and properly instrumented for your 
language. See the [Golang example](/en/core-components/sdk/#golang-sdk-example) 
on importing the SDK.
2. The Streamdal server should be deployed where the services you instrumented 
the SDK are running. If you have confirmed the containers are up, try running 
`curl <server-address>:8080/metrics`. Read more on the 
[endpoints exposed](/en/core-components/server#multi-faceted-api-endpoints) 
by the server component. 
   - The `STREAMDAL_URL` default 
  [environment variable](/en/core-components/sdk/#environment-variables-configuring-the-sdk) 
  value is 
  `localhost:9090`. If you are running the server somewhere other than where 
  your instrumented services live _(which is generally not recommended)_, you 
  will need to update this value to the correct address.
</p>

<Accordion 
title="Rules are listed as 'Coming Soon' but I see them in the console (as 
'beta'). Can I already use them?">
<p>
We are currently beta-testing the data governance features of Streamdal with a 
select group of contributors, companies, and design partners. If you would like 
to become a design partner, [contact us](mailto:support@streamdal.com)
or hit us up on [discord](/en/resources-support/community/).

</Accordion>

{/* TODO: Add launch manifesto link here once available */}
<Accordion 
title="What is open source, what is free, and what is paid? Will this change in 
the future?">
<p>
The observability aspects and features of Streamdal, including
[Tail](/en/guides/tail/), will always be free and open source under the 
[Apache License v2.0](/en/resources-support/license/). Currently, the data 
governance features are in beta, but once they are fully fleshed out and 
developed it will be a paid feature. Check out our 
[launch manifesto](#link-to-launch-manifesto) for details on this design 
decision.
</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion 
title="When will you support <this-feature-language-or-library>?">
<p>
Our [roadmap](/en/resources-support/roadmap/) is publicly available on Github. 
Don't see your library, or think a feature timeline should be shifted? Join our 
community [discord](/en/resources-support/community/) and let us know!
</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion 
title="How do I maintain the data graph?">
<p>
The data graph is real-time and dynamic, and so long as the
[server components](/en/core-components/server/)
are running, and new services are instrumented with the 
[SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/), it will not require maintenance. The view you 
get will always be an accurate representation of data flowing through your 
systems regardless of scale.
</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion 
title="How do I manage schemas?">
<p>
Currently there is no need to manage schemas. Once you have instrumented the 
[SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/), you will be able to view the active schemas of 
data throughout your systems. 
</p>
<br />
<p>
When you weave the `Process()` method throughout your code, behind the scenes 
the SDK will infer and decode schemas, and present them in a human-readable 
format via the [console UI](en/core-components/console-ui/).
</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion 
title="What is Tail?">
<p>
Tail gets its name from the bash command and argument `tail -f`. It is a 
feature that can be used via the console UI, or command line, which will allow 
you to tap into any of your producers or consumers and view the real-time data 
flowing through them.
</p>
<br />
<p>
Because schemas are inferred and decoded, you'll be able to observe your data 
in a human-readable format.
</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion 
title="What are Shims?">
<p>
[Shims](/en/resources-support/glossary/#shims) are a 'wrapper library' for 
popular libraries that incorporate the usage of our SDK to simplify integration 
and adoption of Streamdal. As of [v1.0](/en/resources-support/changelog/) 
release, we have not yet implemented this style of instrumentation yet. Check 
our [roadmap](/en/resources-support/roadmap/) for a better idea on when we will 
begin these implementations.
</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion 
title="What is Observability?">
<p>
Observability can be a really loaded term. Depending on what you're working 
with or who you're speaking to, it can mean many different things. 
</p>
<br />
<p>
When we say observability, we mean:  
> _The ability to simply see the actual real-time data, its schema, and the 
services generating data or interacting with it._
</p>
<br />
<p>
DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) also has a good definition on 
[observability](https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/technical/monitoring-and-observability/#:~:text=Observability%20is%20tooling%20or%20a%20technical%20solution%20that%20allows%20teams%20to%20actively%20debug%20their%20system.%20Observability%20is%20based%20on%20exploring%20properties%20and%20patterns%20not%20defined%20in%20advance.) 
within this context, which defines it as:  
  
> _...tooling or a technical solution that allows teams to actively debug their 
system. Observability is based on exploring properties and patterns not defined 
in advance._
