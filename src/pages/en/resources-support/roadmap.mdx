Our roadmap can be found publicly on 
[Github](https://github.com/orgs/streamdal/projects/1). Before opening a new 
issue or discussion, be sure to search for existing topics and read about 
[contributing](/en/resources-support/contributing). 

For everything else, like: 

- Asking a quick question 
- Participating in polls
- Learning about edge use cases
- Understanding common challenges or implementations
- _Getting the secret Krabby Pattyâ„¢ recipe_

You'll want to join our [community](/en/resources-support/community)!
