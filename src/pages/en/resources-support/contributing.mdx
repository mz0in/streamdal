Thank you for participating in open source! 

We're always open to feature proposals and general contributions to Streamdal. 
Be sure to check out the [code of conduct](#code-of-conduct) before opening up 
a new issue or PR, and take a look at the 
[roadmap](/en/resources-support/roadmap/) to gauge our current projects. 

New to open source? Be sure to check back for some [good first issues](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) 
from time to time.

## Technology Stack
The Streamdal SDK is meant to be implemented in every language and relevant 
library _eventually. 

We currently have an SDK for :
- [Go](/en/sdks/go/)
- [Node](/en/sdks/node/)
- [Python](/en/sdks/python/)


The current technology stack includes:

- WASM
- Protobuf
- gRPC + gRPC-web
- Rust
- Go
- React
- Flowbite
- Deno
- Redis
- Envoy
- _and many more open source libraries and tools!_ ðŸ‘‡

We LOVE open source! Read more on what 
[open source technology](/en/resources-support/open-source/) is used at 
Streamdal, and the [reasons behind that design choice](https://streamdal.com/manifesto).

## Adding an Issue

Before adding an issue, thoroughly read through the documentation 
of each section in [core components](/en/core-components/overview/). You should 
also search for existing issues in their respective repositories:
<ul>
- [Streamdal main repo](https://github.com/streamdal/Streamdal/issues)
- [Streamdal-Console-UI](https://github.com/streamdal/console/issues)
- [Streamdal-Server](https://github.com/streamdal/server/issues)
<br />
_For everything else, including language specific shims or client SDKs, 
you can find those repositories listed on the 
[main repo](https://github.com/streamdal/Streamdal/) readme or by searching 
through the [Streamdal public repositories](https://github.com/streamdal/)._
</ul>

  </div>
</Notification>

Once you have read the documentation and searched through the current issues, 
please include the following formatting and information before opening a new 
issue:

1. Format your issue name with one of the four types:
	- <u>Issue/Bug:</u> You've found a bug with the code, and want to report it, 
  or create an issue to track the bug.
	- <u>Issue/Discussion:</u> You have something on your mind, which requires 
  input from others in a discussion. This could pertain to niche deployments to 
  edge use cases not well documented, or anything you think relevant. Feel free 
  to join the [community](/en/resources-support/community/) to bring greater 
  visibility to your issue or faster collaboration.
	- <u>Issue/Proposal:</u> Used for items that propose a new idea, 
  functionality or feature. This allows feedback from others before writing 
  code. _(This is sometimes marked just_ `feat` _or_ `chore`_)_
	- <u>Issue/Question:</u> Use this issue type if you need help or have a 
  question.
  <br />

2. List the version of everything you are using:
<ul>
  - Streamdal server. The version can be curl'd from the server REST API 
  endpoint by adding /version:
  <br />
  ```
  curl https://streamdal.server:8080/version
  ```
  <br />
  - Streamdal SDK. This is language specific. You can find this in /releases of 
  the url (Replace `$lang` with the language you are using):
  <br />
  ```
  https://github.com/streamdal/$lang-client/releases
  ```
  <br />
  - Streamdal Console UI. `cat` the `version.ts` file located in 
  the root directory where the Console UI is running.
</ul>

3. Include a thorough description of what your code does inside the PR. 
Preferably, include a screenshot if it applies.

## Contributing - Pull Requests

All contributions come through pull requests. Follow these guidelines when 
contributing code or docs to Streamdal:

1. Make sure there's an issue (bug or proposal) raised, which sets the 
expectations for the contribution you are about to make
2. Clone relevant repo and create a new branch
3. Create your change
-- Code changes require tests, and make sure to run the linters to check and 
format the code
4. Update relevant documentation for the change - Please check the [README.MD](https://github.com/streamdal/docs#adding-to-docs) 
for helpful information on contributing to the documentation
5. Commit with [DCO](#developer-certificate-of-origin-signing-your-work) 
sign-off and open a PR
6. Wait for the CI process to finish and make sure all checks are green. A 
maintainer of the project will be assigned, and you can expect a review within 
a few days

Any contribution that you make to Streamdal repositories will be under the Apache 
2.0 License, as dictated by that 
[license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html):

```
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any 
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the 
Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any 
additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall 
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have 
executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
```

### Work-in-progress

A good way to communicate before investing too much time is to create a 
"Work-in-progress" PR and share it with your reviewers. The standard way of 
doing this is to add a "[WIP]" prefix in your PR's title and assign the 
do-not-merge label. This will let people looking at your PR know that it is not 
well baked yet.

### Developer Certificate of Origin: Signing your work

**Every commit needs to be signed**

The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors 
to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they 
are contributing to the project. Here is the full text of the 
[DCO](https://developercertificate.org/), reformatted for readability:

```
By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

    (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the 
    right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or

    (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my 
    knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have 
    the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, 
    whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source 
    license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as 
    indicated in the file; or

    (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who 
    certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.

    (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are 
    public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal 
    information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained 
    indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the 
    open source license(s) involved.
```

Contributors sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a 
`Signed-off-by` line to commit messages.

```
This is my commit message

Signed-off-by: Random Dev <random@dev.example.org>
## Code of Conduct
```

Git even has a -s command line option to append this automatically to your 
commit message:

```
git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
```

Each Pull Request is checked whether or not commits in a Pull Request do 
contain a valid Signed-off-by line.

### Unsigned commits

Forget to sign the commit? No problem! Just amend your changes, sign them, and 
force push them:

```
git checkout <branch-name>
git commit --amend --no-edit --signoff
git push --force-with-lease <remote-name> <branch-name>
```

acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

#### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

#### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[Streamdal.com/contact](https://www.Streamdal.com/contact).
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
