This guide will cover the basics for getting started using Streamdal.

Before we begin, let's familiarize ourselves with a couple of terms that are
used throughout our platform.

## Terminology

### `Collections`

Streamdal hooks directly into your message broker or CDC stream as a polite
consumer, and relays all of the event data/streams to our platform. All of the
data captured is indexed in a logical grouping called a _Collection_. Before we
can tap into any data, a _Collection_ needs to be created and scoped within the
console UI. This is the first step in getting started.

Read more about Collections [here](/en/components/collections/overview/).

### `Plumber`

`plumber` is an open-source Swiss Army Knife CLI tool used for interacting with
messaging and streaming systems like Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS, SQS, and many
others. It also acts as the Streamdal agent. Whether you are working locally,
on-prem, or in the cloud, you can deploy plumber in a variety of ways to
interact with and connect to your systems.

## Step 1: Create your First Collection

After registration, you are put directly into the dashboard view. This is where
you get a holistic view of all data, monitors, and associated logs.

From here you can:

1. Select either the plus icon next to your avatar and username and select
   'Add Collection,' or you can click on the Collections button in the left nav
   pane to create new collections
1. Select schema type
1. Enter a name for the collection
1. Upload schemas (note that plaintext and JSON are inferred, so no upload is
   required!)
1. Configure data lake to use hosted data lake (default)
1. Click create!

  <img src={info} alt="Information" width="30px" height="30px" />
  <p>
    _With every collection created, there is a unique assigned collection token.
    This will be passed to Plumber in order for it to send data to the correct
    Collection._
  </p>
</Notification>

## Step 2: Install and Configure Plumber

Click [here](/en/resources/open-source/plumber-oss/) for detailed instructions
for installing Plumber. Once installed, you will need to connect Plumber to
your broker/messaging system, and create a relay between Plumber and Streamdal
with your collection token.

For this step in the guide, we will be demonstrating on a local RabbitMQ. Check
out the different environment variables
[here](https://github.com/streamdal/plumber/blob/master/docs/env.md) for what
flags to pass for different systems like Kafka, Kineses, SQS, etc.

    Use the following CLI commands to get plumber relaying data to Streamdal.
    <br/>

      1. Start Plumber in server mode
      <br/>

      ```
      plumber server
      ```

      <br/>

      2. In a new terminal window, create the connection between Plumber and
      the broker
      <br/>

      ```
      plumber manage create connection rabbit --name rabbitQuickstart
      ```

      <br/>

      3. Create a relay between Plumber and Streamdal. _This is how we ingest
      data_
      <br/>

      ```
      plumber manage create relay rabbit \
      --connection-id=$id_for_rabbitQuickstart \
      --collection-token=$secret_collection_token --exchange-name=billing \
      --binding-key=billing --queue-name=plumber-billing --queue-durable
      ```

  </div>
  <div class="hidden peer-checked/tab2:block clear-both p-5 w-full">
      Instead of manually entering CLI commands or creating scripts, you can
      containerize plumber in your infrastructure. Below is what the
      docker-compose.yaml looks like for this guide.
      <br/>

      _Note: if you are copying this docker-compose.yaml, just be sure to
      create the exchange and binding key within Rabbit once launched, and link
      it to the plumber-billing queue._

          environment:

            - PLUMBER_RELAY_RABBIT_QUEUE_EXCLUSIVE=false
            - PLUMBER_RELAY_RABBIT_QUEUE_DURABLE=true
            - PLUMBER_RELAY_RABBIT_ADDRESS=amqp://streamdal:streamdal@localhost:5672
            - PLUMBER_RELAY_GRPC_ADDRESS=grpc-collector.batch.sh:9000
          restart: on-failure
    ```

    If you ever need to find Plumber connection IDs, you can use: `plumber get

You can find the collection token in the console UI of the collection you
created:

<img src={token} alt="token" />

Ensure that the environment variable `PLUMBER_RELAY_TOKEN` is set to the unique
collection token. This is similar to the `--collection-token` flag you can pass
manually, and is needed to point Plumber to the unique collection.

## Start Observing Data

And that's it! You can start watching events appear in the
[console](https://console.streamdal.com/collections).

If you've installed Plumber, then you also have a powerful tool for interacting
with your messaging system. Click
[here](/en/resources/open-source/plumber-oss/) to learn how to write data to
your broker with Plumber.
