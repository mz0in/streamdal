Streamdal is a two step process to get up and running. First, you'll need to install the Streamdal [server](/en/core-components/server/) and [console](/en/core-components/console-ui/). Then, you'll need to instrument your code using one of the Streamdal [SDKs](/en/core-components/sdk/).

## <span class="yhighlight">\[STEP 1\]</span> Install Streamdal Server and Console

The quickest way to deploy Streamdal is using the provided script via curl:

```bash
curl -s https://sh.streamdal.com | bash
```
ðŸ‘† The script [installs our docker-compose](/en/guides/deployment#deployments).

Run the `docker ps` command to view the status of the deployment. A successful 
deploy should give a reading similar to this:
```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                       COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                            NAMES
ed6f02a60db1   streamdal/console:v0.1.26   "/tini -- docker-entâ€¦"   1 day ago   Up 10 minutes   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp                           streamdal-console
75823378255d   docker-envoy                "/usr/local/bin/envoâ€¦"   1 day ago   Up 10 minutes   0.0.0.0:8083->8083/tcp, 10000/tcp                streamdal-envoy
aa59c29d9221   streamdal/server:e074107    "/server --debug"        1 day ago   Up 10 minutes   0.0.0.0:8081->8081/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8082->8082/tcp   streamdal-server
750468b0c1bc   redis:latest                "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   1 day ago   Up 10 minutes   0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp                           streamdal-redis
```

ðŸŽ‰ Once everything is up you should be able to access the console at http://localhost:8080 ðŸŽ‰


## <span class="yhighlight">\[STEP 2\]</span> Instrument Your Code
With the server and console up and running, it's time to [instrument your code](../../guides/instrumentation) using one of the Streamdal SDKs. Check out the [SDK documentation](../../guides/instrumentation)) to find the right SDK for your project and learn how to integrate it.

If just want to kick the tires, you can use our demo sdk: 

```bash
docker run \
  --name billing-service-stripe-register \
  --label app=billing-service-stripe-register \
  streamdal/demo-client:2249e0f \
  -d \
  --message-rate=10,20 \
  --service-name=billing-service \
  --server-address=localhost:8082 \
  --operation-type=2 \
  --operation-name=stripe-register \
  --component-name=stripe \
  --data-source-type=file \
  --data-source-file=/assets/sample-billing-producer.json
```  

## <span class="yhighlight">\[STEP 3\]</span> Explore the Console

Once an SDK is connected to your server you should be able to see the data 
flowing in the Console UI.
