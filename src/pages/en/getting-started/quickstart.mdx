Streamdal is a two step process to get up and running. First, you'll need to install the Streamdal server and console. Then, you'll need to instrument your code using one of the Streamdal SDKs.

## [STEP 1] Install Streamdal Server and Console

The quickest way to deploy Streamdal is using the provided script via curl:

```bash
curl -s https://sh.streamdal.com | bash
```
The script installs our docker-compose you can read up more about it [here](../../guides/deployment).

Run the following command to view the status of the deployment:
```bash
❯ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                       COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                            NAMES
ed6f02a60db1   streamdal/console:v0.1.26   "/tini -- docker-ent…"   1 day ago   Up 10 minutes   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp                           streamdal-console
75823378255d   docker-envoy                "/usr/local/bin/envo…"   1 day ago   Up 10 minutes   0.0.0.0:8083->8083/tcp, 10000/tcp                streamdal-envoy
aa59c29d9221   streamdal/server:e074107    "/server --debug"        1 day ago   Up 10 minutes   0.0.0.0:8081->8081/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8082->8082/tcp   streamdal-server
750468b0c1bc   redis:latest                "docker-entrypoint.s…"   1 day ago   Up 10 minutes   0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp                           streamdal-redis
```

🎉 Once everything is up you should be able to access the console at http://localhost:8080 🎉


## [STEP 2] Instrument Your Code
With the server and console up and running, it's time to [instrument your code](../../guides/instrumentation) using one of the Streamdal SDKs. Check out the [SDK documentation](../../guides/instrumentation)) to find the right SDK for your project and learn how to integrate it.

If just want to kick the tires, you can use our demo sdk: 

```bash
docker run \
  --name billing-service-stripe-register \
  --label app=billing-service-stripe-register \
  streamdal/demo-client:2249e0f \
  -d \
  --message-rate=10,20 \
  --service-name=billing-service \
  --server-address=localhost:8082 \
  --operation-type=2 \
  --operation-name=stripe-register \
  --component-name=stripe \
  --data-source-type=file \
  --data-source-file=/assets/sample-billing-producer.json
```  

## [STEP 3] Explore the Console

Once an SDK is connected to your server you should be able to see the data flowing in the console. Checkout the [console documentation](../../guides/console) to learn more about the console and how to use it.
