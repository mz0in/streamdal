"Streamdal operates by integrating our open-source SDK into your code. The SDK then communicates with our server and can be managed through our Console UI.

## üöÄ Typical Workflow
To start using Streamdal you will need to:

1. **Deploy** [The Server](../../guides/deployment)
2. **Integrate** [The SDK](../../core-components/sdk) into your application
3. **Manage** via [The Console UI](../../core-components/console-ui)

## üîç Server and SDK: A Closer Look

It's not necessary to delve deep to use Streamdal, understanding the interplay between our server and SDK can be helpful.

1. **Registration**: Post integration, the SDK registers with the Streamdal server, affirming its status and its readiness to exchange data.
2. **Communication via gRPC**: The SDK and server converse over gRPC, ensuring efficient bidirectional streaming and reliable data transmission.
3. **Metrics Reporting**: After registration, the SDK sends metrics to the server. These insights reveal data flow patterns, potential bottlenecks, and other key metrics.
4. **Fetching Rules (Beta)**: The SDK retrieves the latest WASM-compiled rules from the server. These rules, vital for data processing, ensure immediate reflection of any changes in data logic within the SDK.

##  Access the Console UI
Once the SDK and Server are connected you will manage your data via the [Console UI](../../core-components/console-ui)

1. **Discover Schemas**: View and edit schemas.
2. **Tail**: View Data flow in real-time.
3. **View Metrics**: View metrics and data flow patterns.
4. **Manage Pipelines (Beta)**: Create, edit, attach, and delete pipelines.
