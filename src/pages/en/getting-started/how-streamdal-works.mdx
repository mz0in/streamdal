Streamdal operates by integrating our 
[open-source](/en/resources-support/open-source/) SDK into your code. The SDK 
then communicates with our server and can be managed through our Console UI.

## üöÄ Typical Workflow
To start using Streamdal you will need to:

## üîç Server and SDK: A Closer Look

You don't need to go really deep to use Streamdal. But, understanding the 
interplay between our server and SDK can be _very_ helpful:

1. **Registration**: Post integration, the [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) registers with the Streamdal [server](/en/core-components/server/), affirming its status and its readiness to exchange data.
2. **Communication via gRPC**: The SDK and server converse over gRPC, ensuring efficient bidirectional streaming and reliable data transmission.
3. **Metrics Reporting**: After registration, the SDK sends [metrics](/en/engineering/metrics/) to the server. These insights reveal data flow patterns, potential bottlenecks, and other key metrics.
4. <img src={beta} alt="Beta" style="display: inline" /> **Fetching Rules**: The SDK retrieves the latest <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary#wasm" class="pkeyword">WASM</a>-compiled rules from the server. These <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a>, vital for data processing, ensure immediate reflection of any changes in data logic within the SDK.

##  Access the Console UI
Once the SDK and Server are connected you will manage your data via the [Console UI](../../core-components/console-ui)

1. **Discover Schemas**: View and edit schemas.
2. **[Tail](/en/guides/tail/)**: View Data flow in real-time.
3. **View Metrics**: View metrics and data flow patterns.
4. <img src={beta} alt="Beta" style="display: inline" /> **Manage Pipelines**: Create, edit, attach, and delete <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary#pipeline-or-ruleset" class="pkeyword">pipelines</a>.
