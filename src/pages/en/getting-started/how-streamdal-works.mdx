## üñ•Ô∏è Deploy Server and Console UI

The Streamdal server is the heart of your setup, responsible for a multitude of tasks:
- Orchestrating data flow and communication.
- Ensuring secure and efficient data management.
- Integrating seamlessly with the SDK and Console UI. 

[Setting up the Streamdal Server](../../guides/deployment) on Your Network

Below is a visual representation of the deployment architecture:

With the server in place, integrate the Streamdal SDK into your application. Here's a breakdown of how the SDK communicates:

1. **Registration**: Once integrated, the SDK will register itself with the Streamdal server, confirming its active status and readiness to send/receive data.

2. **Communication via gRPC**: The SDK and Streamdal server communicate over gRPC, This ensures efficient, bi-directional streaming and ensures robust data delivery.

3. **Metrics Reporting**: Post registration, the SDK begins sending metrics to the Streamdal server. These metrics provide valuable insights into the data flow, potential bottlenecks, and other crucial aspects.

5. **Fetching Rules (Beta)**: The SDK fetches the latest WASM-compiled rules from the server. These rules determine how data is processed, ensuring that any changes in data processing logic are immediately reflected in the SDK.
