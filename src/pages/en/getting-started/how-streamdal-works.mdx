Here's a simple workflow to understand how Streamdal's components interact:

## <span class="number-badge">1</span> Deploy Server and Console UI

## Start by [Setting up the Streamdal Server](../../guides/deployment) on Your Network

The Streamdal server plays a pivotal role in your setup, handling various tasks:

- [Streamdal Server Repository](https://github.com/streamdal/server-repo-link)

##  <span class="number-badge">2</span> Load the SDK

With the server in place, integrate the Streamdal SDK into your application. Here's a breakdown of how the SDK communicates:

1. **Registration**: Once integrated, the SDK will register itself with the Streamdal server, confirming its active status and readiness to send/receive data.

2. **Communication via gRPC**: The SDK and Streamdal server communicate over gRPC, This ensures efficient, bi-directional streaming and ensures robust data delivery.

3. **Metrics Reporting**: Post registration, the SDK begins sending metrics to the Streamdal server. These metrics provide valuable insights into the data flow, potential bottlenecks, and other crucial aspects.

5. **Fetching Rules (Beta)**: The SDK fetches the latest WASM-compiled rules from the server. These rules determine how data is processed, ensuring that any changes in data processing logic are immediately reflected in the SDK.
