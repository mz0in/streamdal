The [schema publisher](https://github.com/streamdal/schema-publisher) is a GitHub Action that facilitates automatic publishing of schema updates to Streamdal.

The action utilizes the schema API. If you are using another CI system, you can use the [`schema-publisher`](https://github.com/streamdal/schema-publisher/tree/main/publish) Golang binary to facilitate the push OR use the schema API directly.
