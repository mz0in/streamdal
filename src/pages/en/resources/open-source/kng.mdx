`kng` is a _tiny_ Kafka client wrapper lib that we use for all of our producers and consumers.

This library uses both [segmentio/kafka-go](https://github.com/segmentio/kafka-go) and [Shopify/sarama](https://github.com/Shopify/sarama).

You can find our lib here: [https://github.com/streamdal/kng](https://github.com/streamdal/kng)
