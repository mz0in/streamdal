[Rabbit](https://github.com/streamdal/rabbit) is our Golang [streadway/amqp](https://github.com/streadway/amqp) wrapper library that we use for communicating with our internal RabbitMQ instances.

We make _significant_ use of RabbitMQ internally because of its sophisticated routing capabilities.

While the `streadway/amqp` library is performant and reliable, it does not support automatic reconnects or `context` usage (for cancellation).

Our `rabbit` library aims to address that.

NOTE: We also use Kafka internally for which we use the [segmentio/kafka-go](https://github.com/segmentio/kafka-go) lib.
