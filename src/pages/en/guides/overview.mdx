## Introduction

Plumber is a versatile tool that helps developers inspect, debug, and interact with message brokers and databases. This guide provides an extensive list of examples demonstrating how to use Plumber with several popular message brokers, including Nats, RabbitMQ, and Kafka.

## The core functionality of Plumber includes:

- **Reading messages**: Plumber can connect to a message broker or database and read messages or records. This is particularly useful for inspecting the current state of the data or for debugging.

- **Writing messages**: Plumber can connect to a message broker or database and write messages or records. This is particularly useful for inspecting the current state of the data or for debugging.

- **Relaying messages**: Plumber can also relay messages from one backend to another. This can be used to migrate data, replicate data across systems, or transform data in flight.

In the following sections, we'll provide examples of how to use Plumber with Nats, RabbitMQ, and Kafka.
