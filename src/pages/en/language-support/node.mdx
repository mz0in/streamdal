Welcome to the Node Client Guide for Snitch! If you're harnessing the power of Node.js and aim to supercharge your data operations, you're on the right track. Integrating Snitch into your Node applications is both efficient and straightforward with our Node SDK.

## Kickstart Your Integration

Before diving into the code, ensure you've set the necessary environment variables:

| Variable                 | Description                                                                                              | Default         |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `SNITCH_URL`             | URL pointing to an operational Snitch server within your setup.                                          | `localhost:9091`|
| `SNITCH_TOKEN`           | Authentication token for your Snitch instance.                                                           | `1234`          |
| `SNITCH_SERVICE_NAME`    | The name of your service in your infrastructure.                                                         | `localhost`     |
| `SNITCH_PIPELINE_TIMEOUT`| Total time (in milliseconds) allowed for the execution of the entire pipeline.                           | `100`           |
| `SNITCH_STEP_TIMEOUT`    | Max duration (in milliseconds) allocated for a single step execution within the pipeline.                | `10`            |
| `SNITCH_DRY_RUN`         | A boolean (`true` or `false`) indicating if the SDK should execute in a dry run mode.                    | `false`         |

With the environment set up, it's time to integrate the SDK:

1. Install the SDK package:
```bash
npm install @streamdal/node-sdk-client
```

## 1. Here's a basic example to help you get started:

```bash
import { Snitch, SnitchConfigs, Audience, OperationType } from "@streamdal/snitch-node-client/snitch.js";

const config: SnitchConfigs = {
  snitchUrl: "localhost:9091",
  snitchToken: "1234",
  serviceName: "test-service-name",
  pipelineTimeout: "100",
  stepTimeout: "10",
  dryRun: "false",
};

const audience: Audience = {
  serviceName: "test-service-name",
  componentName: "kafka",
  operationType: OperationType.CONSUMER,
  operationName: "test-kafka-consumer",
};

export const example = async () => {
  const snitch = new Snitch(config);
  const result = await snitch.processPipeline({
    audience,
    data: new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(exampleData)),
  });

  console.log("Snitch Response:");
  console.dir(result, {depth: 20});
};
```
With Snitch's Node client, you're now empowered to redefine your data operations, ensuring efficiency, compliance, and superior performance. Happy coding with Node.js and Snitch!
