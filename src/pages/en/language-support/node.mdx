Welcome to the Node Client Guide for Streamdal! If you're harnessing the power of Node.js and aim to supercharge your data operations, you're on the right track. Integrating Streamdal into your Node applications is both efficient and straightforward with our Node SDK.

    <p>For detailed information on the SDK and its functionalities, refer to the [SDK README](https://github.com/streamdal/go-sdk).</p>
  </div>

With the environment set up, it's time to integrate the SDK:

1. Install the SDK package:
```bash
npm install @streamdal/node-sdk
```

Dive Into an Example
Here's a basic example to help you get started with Streamdal Node SDK:

```bash
import { Streamdal, StreamdalConfigs, Audience, OperationType } from "@streamdal/node-sdk/streamdal.js";

const config: StreamdalConfigs = {
  streamdalUrl: "localhost:8082",
  streamdalToken: "1234",
  serviceName: "test-service-name",
  pipelineTimeout: "100",
  stepTimeout: "10",
  dryRun: "false",
};

const audience: Audience = {
  serviceName: "test-service-name",
  componentName: "kafka",
  operationType: OperationType.CONSUMER,
  operationName: "test-kafka-consumer",
};

export const example = async () => {
  const streamdal = new Streamdal(config);
  const result = await streamdal.processPipeline({
    audience,
    data: new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(exampleData)),
  });

  console.log("Streamdal Response:");
  console.dir(result, {depth: 20});
};
``` 
This example demonstrates how to initialize a new instance of the Streamdal SDK, and how to process data through a pipeline. You simply need to create a configuration object, an audience object, and then call the processPipeline method on a new Streamdal instance. The result will be logged to the console.

## Wasm Execution

<Notification type="information">

  <div class="prose-md prose-p:my-2 prose-a:text-purple-dark prose-a:underline">
    <p>
    To run pipelines with minimal overhead, the Streamdal Node SDK ships and executes pipeline rules as 
    <span class="yhighlight">WASM</span>. If you are using a Node version lower than 
    <span class="yhighlight">20.*</span>, you'll need to enable WASM functionality in your Node app by 
    supplying the flag as shown below:

```bash
node --experimental-wasi-unstable-preview1 ./build/sandbox/index.js
