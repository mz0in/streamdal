Support for Scala is currently not available, but we're planning to add it.

*However, we could use your input!* ðŸ‘‡

## Libraries
Along with additional language support, we plan forking specific libraries that 
would be impactful to have the Snitch functionality. Read more about our 
[Libraries \[Shims\]](/en/core-components/libraries-shims).

Below are some additions we are considering based on feedback from our design 
partners and current users:


|  <u>Messaging Systems</u> |  <u>Database</u> |
|---|---|
|alpakka-kafka|doobie|
|rabbitmq-java|mongo-scala|
|akka-http|slick|
|scala_nats/nats.java|anorm|

The discussions and feedback our users and the open source community brings 
will be incredibly value to feature development.
