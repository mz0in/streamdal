# CDPA Compliance with Snitch

The Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA) necessitates rigorous data protection standards, prioritizing consumer rights to access, correct, and delete personal data. With Snitch, ensuring compliance is streamlined and transparent.

## Snitch's Approach

Using Snitch, you can:

- **Right to Access**: Set up rules that ensure user requests for data access are processed correctly, logging each request to maintain a history of actions taken.
  
  ```Example: Create a rule where, upon receiving a data access request, Snitch verifies the authenticity of the request, logs it, and ensures the necessary data is retrieved.```

- **Right to Correct**: Allow for seamless correction of data by creating workflows that process these requests while maintaining an audit trail.

  ```Example: If a user submits a request to correct their address, Snitch ensures the new address meets validation criteria, replaces the old data, and logs the change.```

- **Right to Delete**: Automate the process of data deletion on user request, ensuring data is permanently removed from all systems.

  ```Example: Upon a user's deletion request, Snitch can trigger a rule to remove the user's data, log the deletion, and send a confirmation to the user.```
