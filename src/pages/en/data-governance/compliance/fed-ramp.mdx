  are currently in beta, and being tested with a select group of contributors, 
  companies, and design partners. If you would like to participate in the beta,

Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) mandates cloud 
services to meet consistent security and quality standards. Achieving and 
maintaining this certification can be complex, but Streamdal simplifies the 
process.

## Streamdal's Approach

Leverage Streamdal for:

- **Data Protection**: You can implement rules on data to consistently govern 
how federal information is processed. Prevent accidental transmission or access 
by disallowing data from leaving its defined boundaries. Ensure development 
environments are not processing, storing, or transmitting federal information.

- **Incident Response**: Streamline your response to security incidents by 
setting up automated workflows that aid your team in rapidly addressing threats.

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement rules to consistently monitor cloud 
environments, detecting and alerting on any unauthorized access or anomalous 
activities that might signify a potential security threat.

> **Coming Soon**: A visual guide on setting up FedRAMP-specific rules in the 
Streamdal UI.

## Regulatory Insights

Understanding the "legalese" of various laws and regulations can be a daunting 
task. Many times this is left to a legal department/entity to help 
organizations understand regulatory compliance. While a one-size-fits-all tool 
does not exist for a complete compliance solution, Streamdal will greatly 
reduce_ the time, effort, and headache around handling data and _revolutionize 
how you can govern it!_

Below are a few key concepts taken from the _FedRAMP CSO's Impact 
Levels[^1]_ along with how Streamdal can help with data compliance:

| Key Concepts | How Streamdal helps comply |
|-|-|
| #1 (All Impact levels): Defining Your Authorization Boundary in the Cloud | Streamdal can play a key part in defining and protecting data boundaries for the authorizing officials operating in your systems. You can write rules for controlling access to data, and rules to protect the flow of all federal information and metadata from leaving its boundaries. |
| #4 (FR-High): Interconnections in the Cloud | Streamdal will significantly uncomplicate the disclosing process to the AO (Agency of Authorizing Authority). Without necessarily defining rules, simply using the observability Streamdal offers will surface all of the data handling portions of your systems. |

    <p>_Did you know: An <u>API that calls data from an external source</u>, 
    <u>IaaS that a PaaS or SaaS resides upon</u>, or external systems that 
    provide <u>audit logging</u>, <u>vulnerability scanning</u>, or 
    <u>ticketing systems</u> are all examples of external services that could 
    impact the CIA (confidentiality, integrity, or availability) of federal 
    information?_</p>

A system’s category is dependent on the potential impact on an agency’s assets and operations should their information and information systems be compromised through unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. These are the standards Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) must employ to ensure their services meet the minimum security requirements for the data processed, stored, and transmitted._
