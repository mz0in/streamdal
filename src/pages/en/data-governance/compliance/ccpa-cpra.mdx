The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) demands strict data protection 
standards. Streamdal can help you navigate these regulations efficiently.

## Streamdal's Approach

With Streamdal's data compliance features, you can:

- Establish robust rules to ensure data processing is in line with CCPA 
requirements.
- Receive real-time alerts on potential data breaches or violations.
- Store and analyze data operation logs for CCPA audit readiness.

> **Coming post-beta**: An illustrative guide on setting up the appropriate 
rules in the Streamdal UI for CCPA data compliance.

## Regulatory Insights

Understanding the "legalese" of various laws and regulations can be a daunting 
task. Many times this is left to a legal department/entity to help 
organizations understand regulatory compliance. While a one-size-fits-all tool 
does not exist for a complete compliance solution, Streamdal will _greatly 
reduce_ the time, effort, and headache around handling data and _revolutionize 
how you can govern it!_

Below are a few sections taken from the CCPA[^1] text with how Streamdal 
can help with data compliance:

| § Sections | How Streamdal helps comply |
|-|-|
| § 7002 (a)-(1)(2): Restrictions on the Collection and Use of Personal Information. | The Streamdal SDK can enforce rules on consumers and producers to reject or alert on data if it contains more personal data than what is necessary, ensuring data minimization. |
| § 7021: <br /> Timelines for Responding to Requests to Delete, Requests to Correct, and Requests to Know. | Streamdal can greatly assist with the timeliness of these requests in two ways: <br /><br /> <ol><li>The UI can visually indicate which producers and consumers are handling PII, and this information can be used to map their end systems, helping reduce discovery time.</li> <br /><li>The SDK rules can be set up to strip, restrict, obfuscate, and mask data, as well as rules on time fields, helping enforce data policies around retention, transmission, and consumption of PI/PI. This can greatly reduce the time spent servicing these requests.</li></ol> |
| § 7027 (g): <br /> Requests to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information. | For the same reasons listed in the above two cells, Streamdal can help limit the use and disclosure of sensitive PI/PII. |
