The <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=HB4" target="_blank">Texas Data Privacy and Security Act</a> 
_(TDPSA)_ is a Texas law that will go into effect on July 1, 2024. It regulates 
the collection, processing, and use of sensitive data.

Streamdal can help keep your data in compliance with this regulation.

## <img src={beta} alt="Beta" style="display: inline" /> Streamdal's Approach

You can leverage Streamdal for:

ðŸš· **<span class="ykeyword">Data Minimization</span>:** The Streamdal [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) can enforce <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a> on <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer" class="pkeyword">consumers</a> and <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer" class="pkeyword">producers</a> to reject or alert on data if it contains more personal data than what is necessary, ensuring data minimization.
{/* */}
ðŸŽ­ **<span class="ykeyword">De-identifying and Masking Data</span>:** From the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/), you can establish <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a> and attach them to your <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer" class="pkeyword">producers</a> and <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer" class="pkeyword">consumers</a> as <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#pipeline-or-ruleset" class="pkeyword">pipelines</a> that data must adhere to in order to proceed through your systems. You can have the [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) filter and alert for PII, and obfuscate sensitive fields to ensure only pseudonymous data is used in appropriate systems.

[Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/).

## Regulatory Insights

Understanding various laws, regulations, and compliance guidelines can be 
daunting. We always recommend developing your data policies with a legal 
department, security/GRC consultant, or your friendly neighborhood DevOps 
professional ðŸ˜„.

The purpose of this section is to make researching these regulations easier and 
to give a better idea of where Streamdal could be the most impactful for your 
organization. In most cases, <u>the combination of</u> the always free and 
[open source](/en/resources-support/open-source/) aspects of Streamdal and the 
[data governance](/en/data-governance/overview/) capabilities will ensure 
successful compliance. 

While more sections could be applicable, below are two taken from the 
_TDPSA[^1]_ along with how Streamdal can help with data compliance:

| Â§ Sections | How Streamdal helps comply |
|-|-|
| Sec. 541.101 Controller Duties; Transparency. | The Streamdal [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) allows you to create [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) ensuring only necessary data is collected and moves through your systems. <br /><br /> For example, you could ensure fields like `social security number`, `IP address`, or `credit card number` are never transferred into storage or critical environments, or are obfuscated/masked. |
| Sec. 541.106 Deidentified or Pseudonymous Data.| Similar to ensuring data minimization, you can establish [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) to ensure data is deidentified or made pseudonymous before it reaches your analytical systems. <br /><br /> Fields like `name`, `address`, `e-mail`, and much more can all be masked or turned into pseudonymous data in real time. |
