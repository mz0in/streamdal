The <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title59.1/chapter53/" target="_blank">Consumer Data Protection Act of Virginia</a> 
_(VCDPA)_ necessitates rigorous data protection standards, prioritizing 
consumer rights to access, correct, and delete personal data. With Streamdal, 
ensuring compliance is streamlined and transparent.

## Streamdal's Approach

With Streamdal's data compliance features, you can enable:

üìâ **<span class="ykeyword">Data Minimization</span>:** Establish robust 
<a href="#" class="pkeyword">rules</a> to ensure data processing is in 
line with VCDPA requirements.
{/* */}
‚è≥ **<span class="ykeyword">Timely Response to Requests</span>:** The combination of the [open source](/en/resources-support/open-source/) and 
[data governance](/en/data-governance/overview/) Streamdal components will 
enable you to easily comply with customer data requests by helping automate 
inquiries.


> **Coming Soon**: A visual guide on setting up VCDPA-specific rules in the 
[Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/).

## Regulatory Insights

Understanding various laws, regulations, and compliance guidelines can be 
daunting. We always recommend developing your data policies with a legal 
department, security/GRC consultant, or your friendly neighborhood DevOps 
professional üòÑ.

The purpose of this section is to make researching these regulations easier and 
to give a better idea of where Streamdal could be the most impactful for your 
organization. In most cases, <u>the combination of</u> the always free and 
[open source](/en/resources-support/open-source/) aspects of Streamdal and the 
[data governance](/en/data-governance/overview/) capabilities will ensure 
successful compliance. 

While more sections could be applicable, below are two sections taken from the 
_VCDPA[^1]_ text with how Streamdal can help with data compliance:

| ¬ß Sections | How Streamdal helps comply |
|-|-|
| ¬ß 59.1-578: <br /> Data controller responsibilities; transparency. | The Streamdal SDK can enforce [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) on [consumers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer) and [producers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer) to reject or alert on data if it contains more personal data than what is necessary, ensuring data minimization. |
| ¬ß 59.1-580: <br /> Data protection assessments. | From the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/), you can make [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) to ensure that wherever PII moves and is processed throughout your systems, it is documented for record-keeping and assessment requirements. Streamdal can effectively automate consumer inquiries on personal data. |
