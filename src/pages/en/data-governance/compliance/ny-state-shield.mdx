  <p style="font-weight: lighter;">The data compliance features of Streamdal 
  are currently in beta, and being tested with a select group of contributors, 
  companies, and design partners. If you would like to participate in the beta,

The New York <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/S5575" target="_blank">"Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security Act"</a> 
_(SHIELD Act)_ aims to enhance the protection of New Yorkers' private information 
by requiring businesses to implement reasonable security safeguards and 
broadening the notification requirements to consumers in the event of a data 
breach.

Streamdal will strengthen technical safeguards for data in motion, along with 
helping assess and mitigate risks with data processing and transmission.

## Streamdal's Approach

You can leverage Streamdal for:

- üöì **<span class="ykeyword">Enforcing data handling policies</span>:** You can establish <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a> and <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#pipeline-or-ruleset" class="pkeyword">pipelines</a> that data must adhere to from the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/). For example, you could obfuscate `social security numbers`, `names`, `addresses`, or other PII data before it enters sensitive data stores, and block or limit PII from entering critical environments.
{/* */}
- üîç **<span class="ykeyword">Assessing and mitigating risks for real-time data</span>:** Within the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/), the [Data Graph](/en/core-components/console-ui#data-graph) provides a view of the flow of data throughout your systems. From there, you can tap into real-time data with [Tail](/en/guides/tail/) to better understand data flow or anomalies, and ensure data handling policies are compliant.

> **Coming Soon**: A visual guide on setting up N.Y. SHIELD-specific rules in the 
[Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/).

## Regulatory Insights

Understanding various laws, regulations, and compliance guidelines can be 
daunting. We always recommend developing your data policies with a legal 
department, security/GRC consultant, or your friendly neighborhood DevOps 
professional üòÑ.

The purpose of this section is to make researching these regulations easier and 
to give a better idea of where Streamdal could be the most impactful for your 
organization. In most cases, <u>the combination of</u> the always free and 
[open source](/en/resources-support/open-source/) aspects of Streamdal and the 
[data governance](/en/data-governance/overview/) capabilities will ensure 
successful compliance. 

While more sections could be applicable, below is one taken from the 
_NY State SHIELD Act[^1]_ along with how Streamdal can help with data 
compliance:

| ¬ß Sections | How Streamdal helps comply |
|-|-|
| 899-bb. Data security protections (2) Reasonable security requirement | The Streamdal [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) will enforce [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) and [pipelines](/en/resources-support/glossary/#pipeline-or-ruleset) you define in the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/) for all your real-time data, and ensure your data handling policies are enforced <u>every time data moves.</u> <br /><br /> The [Data Graph](/en/core-components/console-ui#data-graph) will provide a visual flow of data through your systems, and [Tail](/en/guides/tail/) allows you to tap into real-time data to explore data and any anomalous activities. |

    _The NY SHIELD Act defines "compliant regulated entities," 
    along with small businesses, as <u>any person or business that is subject 
    to</u> the [GLBA](/en/data-governance/compliance/glba/), [HIPAA](/en/data-governance/compliance/hipaa/), <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/hitech-act-enforcement-interim-final-rule/index.html" target="_blank">HITECH</a>, or "any other data security rules and
