  <p style="font-weight: lighter;">The data quality features of Streamdal 
  are currently in beta, and being tested with a select group of contributors, 
  companies, and design partners. If you would like to participate in the beta, 
  please 
  [reach out to us](/en/resources-support/get-support/).</p>
</Notification>

As briefly mentioned in the [overview](/en/data-governance/overview), Streamdal 
can also be used to ensure data quality across your team or organization _with 
breathtaking swiftness_. Once we are out of beta, this section will detail how 
you can use [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#step--rule), 
[pipelines](/en/resources-support/glossary/#pipeline), and 
[functions](/en/resources-support/glossary/#wasm) to ensure data quality, 
design data contracts, and streamline data validation.
