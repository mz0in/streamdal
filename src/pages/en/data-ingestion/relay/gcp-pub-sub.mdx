In this guide, we will cover how to relay Google Cloud Pub/Sub messages to Streamdal using Plumber. This can be particularly useful when you need to migrate data, forward messages, or transform data in transit from GCP Pub/Sub to Streamdal.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you will need the following:

- Plumber installed on your machine.
- A GCP Pub/Sub subscription.
- Your GCP project ID.
- Your GCP Pub/Sub subscription ID.

## GCP Pub/Sub Relay

To relay a GCP Pub/Sub subscription to Streamdal, we will use the `plumber relay` command. Here's the command to set up the relay:

```shell
plumber relay gcp-pubsub --project-id=PROJECT-ID --sub-id=SUB-ID
Make sure to replace PROJECT-ID and SUB-ID with your actual GCP project ID and subscription ID respectively.
```

## Understanding the Plumber Command

Here's a breakdown of the Plumber command:

`relay:` This is the main command that tells Plumber to start in relay mode.
`gcp-pubsub:` This tells Plumber that the data source is GCP Pub/Sub.
`--project-id:` This is your GCP project ID.
`--sub-id:` This is your GCP Pub/Sub subscription ID.
After running this command, Plumber will start relaying data from the specified GCP Pub/Sub subscription to Streamdal.

Please note that you need to adjust the details according to your actual setup and security requirements.
