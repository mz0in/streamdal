Dead Letter Monitors serve an essential role in event-driven systems by tracking events that have incorrect or incompatible schemas, as well as those with bad encodings. Such events are typically routed to a "dead letter" queue for further analysis and resolution.

## Monitor Rules

### Message Sent to Dead Letter

The 'Message Sent to Dead Letter' rule triggers whenever an event with a bad schema or encoding is detected and sent to the Dead Letter. It serves as an important alert to identify issues with event schemas or encodings that might need correction.

## Dead Letter Monitor Configuration

1. Navigate to [Monitor](https://console.streamdal.com/monitor) in the console, and click the `+` button to create a new monitor.
2. Name the monitor.
3. Select the monitor type 'dead letter'.
4. Attach an alert to the monitor using the rule `Message Sent to Dead Letter`.
