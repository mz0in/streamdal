## Allow Streamdal access to your topic

In order to use a PubSub topic as a replay destination, you will need to allow our IAM user permissions to list/publish to your topic

First, open the topic you wish to replay to in Google Cloud's console

On the right-hand side, under the Permissions tab, click "**+ Add Principal**" button

![Click Add Principal](files/undefined)

Enter in our IAM user into the "New Principals" text box

**IAM USER:**

---

**batch-pubsub@batch-website-315819.iam.gserviceaccount.com**

![Enter in our IAM user](files/undefined)

In the "Select A Role" dropdown, select Pub/Sub -> Pub/Sub Publisher

![Add Pub/Sub Publisher role](files/undefined)

Then click "+ Add Another Role" and select Pub/Sub -> Pub/Sub Viewer.

Your permissions should then look like the following. Save the permissions.

![Add both Pub/Sub Publisher and Pub/Sub Viewer roles](files/undefined)

Streamdal's systems will now be able to publish messages to your topic!. Now we just setup the destination in Streamdal

## Setup destination in streamdal.com Console

Head on over to the Destinations page: [https://console.streamdal.com/destinations](https://console.streamdal.com/destinations)

Click the "New Destination" button in the upper right, select **GCP PubSub** from the **Type** dropdown and fill out your GCP project ID and topic ID.
