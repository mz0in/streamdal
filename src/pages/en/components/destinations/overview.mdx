A **destination** determines where [replayed](/en/components/replays/) data will be sent.

Streamdal currently supports the following replay destinations:

- **Kafka**
- **RabbitMQ**
- **Amazon SQS**
- **HTTP**
- **NATS**
- **Redis PubSub**
- **Redis Streams**
- **Google Cloud PubSub**
- **A running instance of Plumber**

A replay destination can either be:

- A publicly accessible resource (such as an internet connected Kafka instance on Confluent)
- or
- A [tunnel](/en/components/tunnels/) created via `plumber`

A destination will be automatically health-checked for you and its status will be available in the destination view and on the dashboard.

If a destination is "unhealthy", it means that Streamdal is not able to communicate with it and a replay is _likely_ going to fail.

Streamdal will replay data to the destination from the [following IP's](undefined).

## Optimal Destination (Geo) Location

Streamdal's "replayers" are hosted in AWS in the `us-west-2` region.

To optimize for throughput, your destinations should be located as physically close as possible to Streamdal's servers.

If you are unable to "get closer" and require high throughput `10,000+ events/s`, [reach out to us](https://streamdal.com/contact) and we'll see what we can do about standing up infrastructure that's located closer to you.

## Kafka Destination

1. Expose a destination to Streamdal's outbound [IPs](https://app.gitbook.com/@batch-1/s/docs/~/drafts/-Mjes-eK8lsaN9vQsP8r/resources/faq#what-are-the-outbound-ips-that-batch-uses-for-replays)
2. Navigate to 'Destination' and select 'New Destination'
