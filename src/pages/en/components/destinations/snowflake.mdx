Data ingested by Streamdal can also be sent to Snowflake. We currently support
batch exports directly from your [search](/en/components/collections/search/)
queries. When importing from Streamdal, tables do not need to be pre-created in
Snowflake as they will be defined by the incoming data.

      Your data is always available as parquet files in AWS S3. You can always
      [load directly from your bucket](/en/advanced/data-science/) to support
      other data science tasks.

## Exporting to Snowflake

1. Navigate to the general tab of the
   [collection](/en/components/collections/overview/) that contains the data you
   would like to send
2. Search/query your data
3. Click the export button to the right of your query
4. Fill out the export form, _optionally_ applying one or more
   [functions](/en/components/functions/overview/) to operate on data
5. Click export

After initiating the export, you are taken to the export tab of your
collection where you can view the status. Your data should now be available in
Snowflake.

#### Export Example:

<video
  src={snowflake}
  type="video/mp4"
  alt="Streamdal Snowflake Export"
  controls
></video>

### Troubleshooting

If you do not see your data in Snowflake, or if the export tab of your
collection shows `status | Aborted` next to your export, then you can drill
into the export and view the logs for errors. You can also view these from the
audit log in the [console dashboard](https://console.streamdal.com/).

For 403 errors, ensure that your credentials are correct. This error usually
occurs when improperly entering the organization
([Snowflake Account
identifier](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier))
field incorrectly in the export form.
