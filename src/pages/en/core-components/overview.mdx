Snitch's power emerges from the intricate collaboration of its primary components. Together, the Snitch Server, Console UI, and SDK form a cohesive framework, driving real-time data operations with an emphasis on flexibility, security, and efficiency.

## The Snitch Server: Rule Translation Hub

Acting as a pivotal connector, the Snitch Server receives rules formulated via the Console UI. It then seamlessly translates these rules into **WebAssembly (WASM)**, ensuring that the SDK can execute them in real-time. This dynamic WASM translation ensures rules are not just stored but are transformed into actionable directives, enabling immediate data operations.

With diverse API offerings:
- The **gRPC API on port 9090** serves the SDK, transmitting WASM-translated rules.
- The **gRPC-Web API on port 9091** integrates with the Console UI, reflecting rule updates.
- The **REST API on port 8080** provides utility functions, including metrics and health checks.

## Console UI: The Visual Command Center

The Console UI serves as the interactive platform for rule creation, visualization, and management. Users can craft dynamic rules and visualize 'pipelines' which provide insights into consumers, producers, and topics.

With two primary views:
- The **Dashboard View** offers a graphical representation of pipelines, alongside stats on consumers and producers.
- The **Pipeline View** lets users mold rules revolving around detection (PII), encoding, decoding, and data transformation.

## SDK: The Execution Engine

Snitch's SDK is more than just a communicator. Streamdal ensures the SDK's easy integration by maintaining forks of popular messaging libraries. This approach allows existing applications to adopt Snitch's capabilities without massive code overhauls.

Users can configure the SDK using environment variables, which cater to:
- Connectivity settings like `SNITCH_URL` and `SNITCH_TOKEN`.
- Execution preferences such as timeouts and dry runs.
- Designating the data source using `SNITCH_DATA_SOURCE`.

Moreover, the Golang version of the SDK offers a glimpse into its simplicity and effectiveness, making data operations a breeze.

Together, the synergy of the Snitch Server's translation prowess, Console UI's visualization and rule creation, and the SDK's real-time execution creates an ecosystem where data security, transformation, and compliance are actualized with unmatched efficiency. Dive deeper into each core component to understand and harness the full potential of Snitch in your data operations.
