Streamdal's strength lies in its comprehensive observability capabilities. The Streamdal Server, Console UI, and SDK offers an intuitive and detailed view of your service, consumers, and producers in real-time.

## Streamdal Server: Your Live Observability Hub

Streamdal Server is more than just a connector; it's your observability powerhouse. It provides a live map of your service, highlighting the intricacies of consumers and producers. This live view is complemented with detailed metrics on messages published, consumed per second, and bytes per second.

With robust API offerings:
- The **gRPC API on port 9090** aids the SDK, ensuring seamless communication.
- The **gRPC-Web API on port 9091** links with the Console UI, ensuring all updates are reflected in real-time.
- The **REST API on port 8080** provides utility functions, including metrics, health checks, and the novel "tail" feature to view message flow in a JSON format.

## Console UI: The Observability Command Center

The Console UI is an all-in-one platform that showcases the live map, metrics, and schema views. This is where you can visually trace the flow of messages, view them, and understand the schema based on recent events.

- **Dashboard View** offering graphical insights into data flow and statistics.
Coming soon:
- **Pipeline View** allowing users to set and manage rules around data (PII) detection, encoding, decoding, and more.

## SDK: Bridging Real-time Data Flow

Streamdal's SDK ensures quick and effortless integration by maintaining forks of renowned messaging libraries. This facilitates the adaptation of Streamdal's features without requiring a complete code rewrite.

Users can tweak the SDK with environment variables to:
- Set up connectivity with variables like `STREAMDAL_URL` and `STREAMDAL_TOKEN`.
- Specify execution settings and data source with variables like `STREAMDAL_DATA_SOURCE`.

Additionally, the Golang version of the SDK showcases its simplicity and efficiency, streamlining data operations.

In essence, Streamdal brings together the observability features of its Server, the visualization capabilities of the Console UI, and the real-time data flow of the SDK. Together, they form an ecosystem where monitoring, tracing, and data analysis reach new heights. Immerse yourself in each component to unlock the full potential of Streamdal for your operations.
