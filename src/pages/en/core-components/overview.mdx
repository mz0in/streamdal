## 1. Streamdal SDK

The SDK, designed for efficiency, tackles metrics reporting, pipeline processing, and validations using **WebAssembly (WASM)**. This approach assures sub-millisecond overhead, immense scalability, and cross-language compatibility.

### Key Features:

- **Lightweight Design**: Tailored for efficiency, avoiding unnecessary bulk.
- **Real-time Rule Processing**: Employs WASM, achieving [remarkable overheads](https://github.com/streamdal/go-sdk/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md).
- **Console UI-Defined Rules**: Rules are directly defined via the console UI and fetched by the SDK for processing.

For detailed insights, explore the [Streamdal SDK documentation](../sdk).

## 2. Streamdal Server

Acting as the pivotal hub in Streamdal's framework, the Server ensures fluent transformation of Console UI-defined rules into live operations. It integrates rules into the **WebAssembly (WASM)** format, which the SDK impeccably deciphers and executes.

### Core Features:

- **WASM Integration**: Translates rules for swift, real-time operations.
- **High Availability**: Crafted for uninterrupted and consistent data operations.
- **Multi-Component Communication**: Vital in interfacing between different components for smooth data operations.

For a deep dive, refer to the [Streamdal Server documentation](../server).

## 3. Streamdal Console UI 

The Console UI stands as the orchestrator, steering the intricate nuances of data operations. Rooted in a robust GRPC framework, it offers a communicative bridge with the Console Server, granting users an interactive platform for data rule and pipeline management.

### Dashboard View:

- **Data Graph**: Visual representation of consumers, producers, and topics relationships.
- **Real-time Stats**: Insights into performance metrics and data flow rates.
- **Tail View**: Live observation of pipeline data, granting immediate operational feedback.
- **Schema Discovery**: Explore, define, and manage schemas generated from your data events.

### Pipeline View (BETA):

- **Detective (PII) Rules**: Define guidelines for handling Personal Identifiable Information (PII).
- **Encode & Decode Rules**: Manage data encoding and decoding (Coming Soon).
- **Transformation Rules**: Set dynamic data transformation parameters.

For an in-depth tour, navigate to the [Streamdal Console UI documentation](../console-ui).
