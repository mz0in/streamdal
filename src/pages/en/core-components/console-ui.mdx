The Console UI of Snitch is more than just a user interface; it's the cockpit from which the complexities of data operations are orchestrated with grace and precision. Built atop a powerful GRPC framework, it offers a seamless communication channel with the Console Server, providing users with a visual playground to create, manage, and monitor their data rules and pipelines.

## Dashboard View: Your Real-time Pipeline Overview

The Dashboard View is the nerve center of the Console UI, providing users with a holistic representation of their 'pipelines'. Here, you'll witness:

- **Visual Representations**: A graphic layout depicting the interconnections between consumers, producers, and topics in each pipeline.
- **Real-time Stats**: Gain insights into the performance, consumption, and production rates of each entity within your pipelines. Stay updated on how much data is flowing, where it's going, and how fast it's being processed.

## Pipeline View: The Rule Crafting Studio

Switch to the Pipeline View, and you're welcomed into Snitch's rule-crafting domain. Here, users have the flexibility to:

- **Detective (PII) Rules**: Establish guidelines that swiftly pinpoint and manage Personal Identifiable Information (PII), safeguarding user privacy.
- **Encode & Decode Rules**: Define how data is encoded before transmission and decoded upon reception. This ensures data remains consistent and authentic.
- **Transformation Rules**: Set parameters for real-time data transformation, allowing for data to be reshaped and repurposed as per evolving requirements.
