<br />
Designed with efficiency in mind, the SDK handles metrics reporting, pipeline processing, and validations using WebAssembly (WASM). This approach guarantees sub-millisecond overhead, high scalability, and compatibility across various languages.

## Key Features

- **Lightweight Design**: The SDK is crafted to be lean, ensuring efficient runtime without adding bulk.
- **Real-time Rule Processing**: Utilizing WebAssembly (WASM), the SDK boasts sub-millisecond overheads for rule application.
- **Console UI-Defined Rules**: Rules are defined directly through the console UI, and pulled down via the SDK for processing .

## Multi-Language Support

The SDK is currently available in the following languages:

- **[Go](https://github.com/streamdal/go-sdk)**
- **[Node](https://github.com/streamdal/node-sdk)**
- **[Python](https://github.com/streamdal/python-sdk)**

## Instrumentation

The SDK is designed to be integraterd into your application as a library. Please see our [intrumentation guide](../../guides/Instrumentation/).
