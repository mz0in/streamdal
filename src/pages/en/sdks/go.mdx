If you're developing with Go and aim to elevate your data operations, you're in 
the right place. With Streamdal's Go SDK, integrating the power of Streamdal 
into your Go applications has never been simpler.

## Insturmentation

Start with the [instrumentation guide](../../guides/instrumentation) if you 
haven't already. It will walk you through the process of setting up Streamdal 
and its components. 


## Dive Into an Example

Wondering how it works in action? Here's a simple Go code demonstrating the Streamdal integration:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/streamdal/go-sdk"
)

func main() {
	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	defer cancel()

	sc, err := streamdal.New(&streamdal.Config{
		ServerURL:       "localhost:8082",
		ServerToken:     "streamdal",
		StepTimeout:     time.Millisecond * 10,
		PipelineTimeout: time.Millisecond * 100,
		DryRun:          false,
		ServiceName:     "billing-svc",
		ShutdownCtx:     ctx,
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	resp, err := sc.Process(ctx, &streamdal.ProcessRequest{
		OperationType: streamdal.OperationTypeConsumer,
		OperationName: "new-order-topic",
		ComponentName: "kafka",
		Data:          []byte(`{"object": {"field": true}}`),
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("%#v\n", resp)
}
```
## Example Code Breakdown

- **Imports:** 
   - Essential Go packages are imported to support the application's functionality.
   
- **Context Creation:** 
   - A new context is established, ensuring timeouts and graceful shutdowns.

- **Streamdal Client Setup:** 
   - Here, the SDK client is initialized with various configurations, including the server URL, service name, and specific timeout intervals.

- **Error Handling:** 
   - Any initialization errors are caught. Should one occur, the program will immediately halt and display the error message.

- **Data Processing:** 
   - The `Process()` method of the Streamdal client is invoked. This processes the data while specifying details such as the operation type and the actual data to be processed.

- **Output:** 
   - The response from the processed data is then printed to the console, providing insight into the operation's result.
