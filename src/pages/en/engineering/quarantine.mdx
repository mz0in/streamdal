It will be a feature 
that allows data to be _quarantined_ when a 
[pipeline](/en/resources-support/glossary#pipeline) succeeds or fails. It will 
store the data in S3, so that it can be reviewed (and fixed/repaired/etc.) by 
authorized users. 

It's essentially an option that you can enable for successful or failed 
pipeline executions. Think of it somewhat like an advanced deadletter queue. 
More information will be released as we near the development finishline, but 
in the meantime check out our 
[roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/streamdal/projects/1) periodically to keep 
tabs on progress.

greater range of feature discussions!
