Plumber is a versatile tool that supports various modes of operation to cater to your message queue, database, or data pipeline needs. One such mode is the server mode, where Plumber maintains open connections and continuously processes messages as they come in.

## Server Mode

Plumber's server mode can be activated using the `--server` flag. Once activated, Plumer will accept commands to create Connetions, Relay, or create a Destination

1. **Create Connection**: A connection is created to a backend, such as RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc. Which is used will be used for relaying or creating destinations.
2. **Relaying Messages**: A relay is created to a queue or topic using a connection. Plumber reads messages from one source and writes them to the Streamdal console.
3. **Tunnel**: This command will create a desination to a backend, such as RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc. Which is used for replaying messages in the Streamdal console.

The specific arguments and options you use with the `--server` flag will depend on the backend you're connecting to, such as RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc., and your desired outcome. Running `plumber --help` will provide a list of available commands and options.
