Note, this is an [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) app. Astro is an MPA framework that support lots 
of build-time content generation and server side rendering. However we are using
it simply to bundle an SPA that gets served by Plumber. So, ignore anything in the docs about build time 
content generation (e.g. fetching) and server side rendering.
