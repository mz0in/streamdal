## Introduction

Metrics play a crucial role in any observability stack. They provide a quantitative understanding of system behaviors, helping in monitoring, alerting, and performance tuning. Streamdal employs the widely-accepted Prometheus format to define and expose these metrics, ensuring ease of integration and a standardized approach to observability.

## Understanding the Metrics Format

Prometheus, an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit, uses a specific text-based format for metrics. Let's take a brief look:

```plaintext
# HELP streamdal_dataqual_failure_trigger Number of events/bytes that triggered a failure rule, for each failure rule type
# TYPE streamdal_dataqual_failure_trigger counter
...
# HELP streamdal_dataqual_rule Message count and bytes by rule set and rule
# TYPE streamdal_dataqual_rule counter
...
# HELP: Describes the metric's purpose.
# TYPE: Indicates the metric type, e.g., counter, gauge, histogram, etc.
Metric Name: Like streamdal_dataqual_rule, uniquely identifies a metric.
Labels: Enclosed in {}, provide additional dimensions to the metric, e.g., rule_id, ruleset_id, type, etc.
```
## Why This Format?
Self-descriptive: Each metric comes with its descriptor, making it easier for developers and systems to understand its purpose and significance.

High Granularity with Labels: Labels provide multi-dimensional data, allowing for more refined querying, filtering, and aggregation. This is especially important in Streamdal, where understanding metrics in the context of specific rules or rulesets is vital.

Standardization: Using a recognized format ensures easy integration with monitoring systems like Prometheus and visualization tools like Grafana.

Benefits of Having These Metrics in Streamdal
Rules Insights: By observing metrics like streamdal_dataqual_rule, we can infer the throughput of specific rules â€“ both in terms of message counts and bytes processed. This helps in identifying high-traffic rules and any potential bottlenecks.

Failure Triggers: Metrics like streamdal_dataqual_failure_trigger provide invaluable insights into rules that frequently trigger failures. This could help in refining rules or addressing data quality issues.

Performance Monitoring: Observing the message counts and bytes processed over time can provide insights into system performance and resource utilization.

Operational Awareness: Knowing how rules are executed and the associated metrics ensures that operations teams are equipped to handle any spikes in data, system anomalies, or potential outages.

Trend Analysis: Over time, observing these metrics can provide trends, helping in capacity planning, rules optimization, and understanding data flow patterns.

## Conclusion
The Prometheus metrics format is more than just a structured way of representing data. It's a gateway to understanding the behaviors, performance, and health of Streamdal. By integrating this standardized metrics format, Streamdal ensures consistent observability, actionable insights, and enhanced operational excellence.
