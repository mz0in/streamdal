<Changes />

Support for Java is currently not available, but we're planning to add it.

*However, we could use your input!*

## Version

What version of Java should we add support for first?

## Libraries
Along with additional language support, we plan forking specific libraries that 
would be impactful to have the Streamdal functionality. Read more about our 
[Libraries/Shims](/en/core-components/libraries-shims).

Below are some additions we are considering based on feedback from our design 
partners and current users:


|  <u>Messaging Systems</u> |  <u>Database</u> |
|---|---|
|spring-kafka|spring|
|rabbitmq-java|mybatis|
|jms|jbdi|
|httpclient|mongo-java|
|okhttp|msql-connector-java|

The discussions and feedback our users and the open source community brings 
will be incredibly value to feature development.
