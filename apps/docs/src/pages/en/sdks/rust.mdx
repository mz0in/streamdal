Support for Rust is currently not available, but we're planning to add it.

*However, we could use your input!*

## Libraries
Along with additional language support, we plan forking specific libraries that 
would be impactful to have the Streamdal functionality. Read more about our 
[Libraries/Shims](/en/core-components/libraries-shims).

Below are some additions we are considering based on feedback from our design 
partners and current users:


|  <u>Messaging Systems</u> |  <u>Database</u> |
|---|---|
|rust-rdkafka|sqlx|
|lapin|mongo-rust|
|hyper|actix|
|juniper|rust-postgres|
|reqwest|redis-rs|
|nats.rs|diesel|

Join our [discord](https://discord.gg/streamdal) and participate in the polls! 
The discussions and feedback our users and the open source community brings 
will be incredibly value to feature development.
