There are many ways to get support with Streamdal. While Streamdal is a free 
and open source project, if you need help deploying on-prem or in a large 
enterprise environment, we are available to assist!

### Community

Join our [community](/en/resources-support/community). This is the fastest way 
to get to get support and understand how the other users are operating with 
Streamdal.
