Streamdal is an open-source project using the 
[Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

## General Guidelines

Feature proposals and general contributions are cherished and highly 
encouraged!

    New to open source? 
    
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">There should be some [good first issues](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) 
    added periodically. Check out the Streamdal main 
    [README](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/blob/main/README.md) for a 
    list of component repositories, or search through our 
    [public](http://github.com/streamdal) ones to find more of these.</span>
    </p>
  </div>
</Notification>

Here are some simple guidelines to help determine where your efforts could 
provide the most benefit, and ensure contributions go smoothly:

1. Review our [code of conduct](#code-of-conduct)
2. Take a look at our technology stack:

    - Wasm
    - Protobuf
    - gRPC + gRPC-web
    - Rust
    - Go
    - React
    - Flowbite
    - Deno
    - Redis
    - Envoy
    - _...and many more open source libraries and tools_

      Check out our [open source](/en/resources-support/open-source/) 
      page to learn more about what other technologies are used with Streamdal.

3. Take a quick glance at our [manifesto](https://streamdal.com/manifesto) - 
this should help you gauge where our mindset is focused when it comes to future 
development
4. Reference the public [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/streamdal/projects/1) 
on GitHub

## Adding an Issue

<Notification type="checked">
  <img src={checked} alt="checked" width="30px" height="30px" />
  <div class="prose-md prose-p:my-2 prose-a:text-purple-dark prose-a:underline">
  <p>
    Getting support: <span style="font-weight: normal;">We primarily provide 
    support for issues through the [main repo](https://github.com/streamdal/Streamdal/issues).</span>
  </p>
  </div>
</Notification>

For adding issues you should:

1. Be familiar with the [core components](/en/core-components/overview/)
2. Search for existing `issues` in their respective repositories before opening up 
a new one:

    - [Streamdal/Streamdal](https://github.com/streamdal/Streamdal/issues)
    - [Streamdal/Console](https://github.com/streamdal/console/issues)
    - [Streamdal/Server](https://github.com/streamdal/server/issues)

_Everything else, including language-specific shims or client SDKs, should be 
listed on the main repo [README](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/blob/main/README.md) 
or can be found by searching through the 
[Streamdal public repositories](https://github.com/streamdal/)._

### Formatting

1. Format your issue name with one of the four types:
	- <u>Issue/Bug:</u> You've found a bug with the code, and want to report it, 
  or create an issue to track the bug.
	- <u>Issue/Discussion:</u> You have something on your mind, which requires 
  input from others in a discussion. This could pertain to niche deployments, 
  edge use cases not well documented, or anything else that might be relevant. 
	- <u>Issue/Proposal:</u> Used for items that propose a new idea, 
  functionality or feature. This allows feedback from others before writing 
  code. _(This is sometimes marked as_ `feat` _or_ `chore`_)_
	- <u>Issue/Question:</u> Use this issue type if you need help or have a 
  question.
  <br />

2. List the version of everything you are using.

    Outside of referencing the versions pulled in your `docker-compose.yml`, 
    you can do the following for each component:
<ul>
  - **Server:**
  
    You can `curl` the version from the server REST API endpoint by adding 
    /version:
  <br />
  ```
  curl https://streamdal.server:8081/version
  ```
  <br />
  - **SDK:**
  
    This is language specific. You can find this in /releases of 
    the URL (Replace `$lang` with the language you are using):
  <br />
  ```
  https://github.com/streamdal/$lang-sdk/releases
  ```
  <br />
  - **Console UI:**
  
    `cat` the `version.ts` file located in 
    the root directory where the Console UI is running. It is also visually 
    indicated at the bottom left corner of the UI:

  <br />

<img src={console_version} style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="Example of Streamdal console version" />

</ul>

3. Include a thorough description of what your code does inside the PR. 
Preferably, include a screenshot if it applies.

If you feel it necessary, or for some reason an important issue is going 
unnoticed, you are also permitted to cross-post issues to the 
[community](/en/resources-support/community/) for greater visibility.

## Pull Requests

All contributions come through pull requests. Follow these guidelines when 
contributing code or docs to Streamdal:

1. Make sure there's an issue (bug or proposal) raised, which sets the 
expectations for the contribution you are about to make
2. Clone relevant repo and create a new branch
3. Create your change
-- Code changes require tests, and make sure to run linters to check and format 
the code
4. Update relevant documentation for the change - Please check the 
doc's [README](https://github.com/streamdal/docs#adding-to-docs) 
for helpful information on contributing to docs
5. Commit with [DCO](#developer-certificate-of-origin-signing-your-work) 
sign-off and open a PR
6. Wait for the CI process to finish and make sure all checks are green. A 
maintainer of the project will be assigned, and you can expect a review within 
a few days

Any contribution that you make to Streamdal repositories will be under the Apache 
2.0 License, as dictated by that 
[license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html):

```
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any 
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the 
Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any 
additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall 
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have 
executed with the Licensor regarding such Contributions.
```

### Work-in-progress

A good way to communicate before investing too much time is to create a 
"Work-in-progress" PR and share it with your reviewers. The standard way of 
doing this is to add a "[WIP]" prefix in your PR's title and assign the 
do-not-merge label. This will let people looking at your PR know that it is not 
well baked yet.

### Developer Certificate of Origin: Signing your work

**Every commit needs to be signed**

The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors 
to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they 
are contributing to the project. Here is the full text of the 
[DCO](https://developercertificate.org/), reformatted for readability:

```
By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

    (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the 
    right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or

    (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my 
    knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have 
    the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, 
    whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source 
    license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as 
    indicated in the file; or

    (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who 
    certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.

    (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are 
    public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal 
    information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained 
    indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the 
    open source license(s) involved.
```

Contributors sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a 
`Signed-off-by` line to commit messages.

```
<This is my commit message>

Signed-off-by: Random Dev <random@dev.example.org>
```

Git even has a `-s` cli flag to append this automatically to your 
commit message:

```
git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
```

Each PR is checked whether or not the commits contain a valid Signed-off-by 
line.

### Unsigned commits

Forget to sign the commit? No problem! Just amend your changes, sign them, and 
force push them:

```
git checkout <branch-name>
git commit --amend --no-edit --signoff
git push --force-with-lease <remote-name> <branch-name>
```

size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.
<br />
We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.
<br />

community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback

  community

<br />

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

#### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.
<br />
Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

#### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.
