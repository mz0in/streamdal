The Console UI of Streamdal is more than just a user interface; it's the cockpit from which the complexities of data operations are orchestrated with grace and precision. Built atop a powerful GRPC framework, it offers a seamless communication channel with the Console Server, providing users with a visual playground to create, manage, and monitor their data rules and pipelines.

## Dashboard View: Your Real-time Data Flow

The Dashboard View remains the nerve center of the Console UI, offering:

- <span id="data-graph">**Data Graph**</span>: A graphic layout showcasing the relationship between consumers, producers, and topics in each pipeline.
- **Real-time Stats**: Gain insights into performance, consumption, and production rates of each entity.
- **Tail View**: Observe your pipeline data in real-time, ensuring immediate feedback on operations.
- **Schema Discovery**: Explore and define schemas, generated based on events that flow across your schemas

Dive into the Pipeline View to engage in Streamdal's rule-crafting domain:

- **Detective (PII) Rules**: Establish guidelines for managing Personal Identifiable Information (PII).
- **Encode & Decode Rules**: Determine data encoding before transmission and decoding upon reception (TBA).
- **Transformation Rules**: Set real-time data transformation parameters, catering to dynamic requirements.
