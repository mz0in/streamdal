<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" target="_blank">The California Consumer Privacy Act</a> 
_(CCPA)_ demands strict data protection standards. Streamdal can help you 
navigate the data requirements of this regulation efficiently.

## Streamdal's Approach

With Streamdal's data compliance features, you can:

**Data Minimization:** Establish robust <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a> to ensure data processing is in 
line with CCPA requirements.

**Monitoring and Alerts on real-time data:** Receive real-time alerts on 
potential data breaches or violations.

For example, you could set up alerts for a sudden change in data flow rate, 
spikes in logging activity, or sudden influx of data validation errors.

**Timely Response to Requests:** The combination of the [open source](/en/resources-support/open-source/) and 
[data governance](/en/data-governance/overview/) Streamdal [components](/en/core-components/overview/) will enable you to easily comply with 
customer data requests within the timeframe mandated by CCPA.

> **Coming Soon**: A visual guide on setting up CCPA-specific rules in the 
[Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/).

## Regulatory Insights

We wanted to make researching the relevant data regulations easier and give a 
better idea of where Streamdal could be the most impactful for your 
organization. In most cases, the combination of the observability and data 
governance capabilities will ensure successful compliance. 

While more sections should be applicable, below are a few taken from the 
_CCPA[^1]_ text with how Streamdal can help with data compliance:

| § Sections | How Streamdal helps comply |
|-|-|
| § 7002 (a)-(1)(2): Restrictions on the Collection and Use of Personal Information. | The Streamdal [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) can enforce [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) on [consumers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer) and [producers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer) to reject or alert on data if it contains more personal data than what is necessary, ensuring data minimization. |
| § 7021: <br /> Timelines for Responding to Requests to Delete, Requests to Correct, and Requests to Know. | Streamdal can greatly assist with the timeliness of these requests in two ways: <br /><br /> <ol><li>The [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/) can visually indicate which producers and consumers are handling PII, and this information can be used to map their end systems, helping reduce discovery time.</li> <br /><li>[Rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) can be set up to strip, restrict, obfuscate, and mask data, as well as [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) on `time fields`, helping enforce data policies around retention, transmission, and consumption of PI/PI. This can greatly reduce the time spent servicing these requests.</li></ol> |
| § 7027 (g): <br /> Requests to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information. | For the same reasons listed in the above two cells, Streamdal can help limit the use and disclosure of sensitive PI/PII. |
