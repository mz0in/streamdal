The <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title59.1/chapter53/" target="_blank">Consumer Data Protection Act of Virginia</a> 
_(VCDPA)_ necessitates rigorous data protection standards, prioritizing 
consumer rights to access, correct, and delete personal data. With Streamdal, 
ensuring compliance is streamlined and transparent.

## Streamdal's Approach

With Streamdal's data compliance features, you can enable:

**Data Minimization:** Establish robust 
<a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a> to ensure data processing is in 
line with VCDPA requirements.

**Timely Response to Requests:** The combination of the [open source](/en/resources-support/open-source/) and 
[data governance](/en/data-governance/overview/) Streamdal components will 
enable you to easily comply with customer data requests by helping automate 
inquiries.


> **Coming Soon**: A visual guide on setting up VCDPA-specific rules in the 
[Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/).

## Regulatory Insights

We wanted to make researching the relevant data regulations easier and give a 
better idea of where Streamdal could be the most impactful for your 
organization. In most cases, the combination of the observability and data 
governance capabilities will ensure successful compliance. 

While more sections could be applicable, below are two sections taken from the 
_VCDPA[^1]_ text with how Streamdal can help with data compliance:

| § Sections | How Streamdal helps comply |
|-|-|
| § 59.1-578: <br /> Data controller responsibilities; transparency. | The Streamdal SDK can enforce [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) on [consumers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer) and [producers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer) to reject or alert on data if it contains more personal data than what is necessary, ensuring data minimization. |
| § 59.1-580: <br /> Data protection assessments. | From the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/), you can make [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) to ensure that wherever PII moves and is processed throughout your systems, it is documented for record-keeping and assessment requirements. Streamdal can effectively automate consumer inquiries on personal data. |
