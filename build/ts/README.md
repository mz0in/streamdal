## Typescript types and code for Snitch Protobuf

This package contains a protobuf descriptor set at `/protos/protos.fds` as well as Typescript types
for all protos and typescript client code for working with protos at `/protos`.

Additionally there are ESM Module compliant versions at `/esm`. These are suitable for use in Deno
and other ESM Module compliant envs.
